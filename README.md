1."Why should I care? What's in it for me?"
-------------------------------------------

That's a great question. And always the first question asked when someone is trying to sell you something new. We understand. Thanks for asking. 

But before we get to that, let's discuss who you are and how you're probably using Wordpress. 

-- You are: At least somewhat experienced building WP themes and/or WP plugins.
-- You are: Comfortable with the basics of PHP OOP. 
-- You do: Mostly custom WP development and WP customization, as opposed to themes and plugins (either premium or for the WP.org repos)**.
-- You have: Experienced time-sucks from hell trying to find answers and The Google and The Bing are of little help.
-- You have: Planted open palm to forehead and said, "There's got to be a better way."

> ** Note: The WPezClasses framework on whole is not intended to be used in free-standing themes and plugins.
> With that said, it's certainly possible to fork a given class, refractor it (i.e., change the name and such) and incorporate it 
> into your project. Please, feel free. Just understand we're not going to be able (or willing) to support things.
